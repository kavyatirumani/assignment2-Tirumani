###### India
I love my country because India is a nation with unity in **diversity**. It is a proponent of peace. Peace especially through spirituality is a basic and **unique quality** of India.
People from other nations are getting attracted towards India to achieve peace of mind. India is a land of **festivals**.<br> Festivals like Diwali, Holi, do not belong to any one community but is celebrated by all.
